COSC 5340 SU19 Project Description
Joe Welch

Wireless Tool Development

Learning objectives:
Increase proficiency with Python scripting.
Increase awareness of and implementation steps for Python security modules and libraries.
Establish and follow development workflow which uses version control and permits thoughtful build, refactoring and testing.
Pair security exploit information with active wireless behavior to asess patch requirement or exploit availability. 
Document the development to permit subsquent work by myself or interested developers/practicioners.

TODO's (Not all are possible within the scope of the COSC5340 course. May continue work on my own time.)
1. Develop security utility which detects 802.11 behavior.
2. Determine if 802.11 transmissions are unencrypted, WEP, WPA, WPA2 (if possible).
3. Classify AP's, radio cards by MAC and attribute the wireless radios to manufacturer. 
3. Pair database with radio ID to determine if updates are required or if exploits are available.
4. By examining SSID seeking behavior associated with MAC address, infer travel and locationa behavior for detected devices.
