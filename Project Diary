PROJECT DIARY

6/25/2019
Provided initial project submission.

Rationale for project:

Wireless access is becoming dominant.
There are many wireless signals used: 802.11, 802.15, BlueTooth, Cellular, ZigBee, etc.
Common characteristics are sought to determine vulnerabilities and hardening techniques.
Selected spectrum for this project is 802.11 due to availability of wireless cards with necessary capabilities. Selected card should be used to permit monitor mode andpacket injection.

6/27-28/2019
Ordered and received wireless card with monitor mode and packet injection capability.

6/30/2019 - 7/1/2019
Worked with libraries and internet documentation to discern which information about 802.11 signals may be discerned, captured and analyzed with existing utilities. There are many libraries available, of varying use and maturity. My effort will be to implement some of the capabilities via Python mudules, initially  with Scapy module.

Wireless Utility Practice

Practiced repeatedly with the following commands to:
Understand how a card is placed in monitor mode.
View the locally available AP's and STA's.
Select an AP for disassociation and reassociation.
Capture the IV and associated traffic.
Use a password cracking tool to attempt cracking the PSK for the respective AP.

_______________________________________

Commands:
ifconfig -a  			# look for wlan adapter
lsmod 					# look for drivers for LAN card RT2800XXX drivers
ifconfig wlan0 up 		# turn on WLAN, check for up in ifconfig -a WLAN adapter
airmon-ng 				# status check
airmon-ng check kill 	# disable peer processes which may interfere w/ mon mode
airmon-ng start wlan0 	# places WLAN in monitor mode. ifconfig -a 					will                    # WLANmon in listing, airmon-ng will show wlan status
airodump-ng wlan0mon 	# see Access Points around you

airodump-ng				# lists all options

NOTES
Terminal commands in Kali do not exactly match those presented in BT video
Once wlan0 is placed into monitor mode, refer to it as wlan0mon card
Card can work in one band, one channel at a time. My card is b/g/n 
Placing card in monitor mode disables internet access
Use airodump-ng  befor looking for beacon broadcast in Wireshark
______________________
To return to managed mode (remember the managed service processes may not be running):
airmon-ng stop wlan0mon

______________________
Need to review this:
airodump-ng --band n wlan0mon
Error: invalid band (n)

______________________
Injecting Beacon Frames

Using mdk3 currently as the utility to inject packets (beacon fales AP, DDOS, etc.)
After placing card into monitor mode
mdk3 wlan0mon b -n P0wned

** Many features in mdk3 - spend time here
802.11 AP beacon flooding supports a misassociation attack

After setup above, and determinationrmination of channels and SSIDs
